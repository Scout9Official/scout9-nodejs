    context: 'I\'m Tony. Look, this life, it ain\'t for the faint-hearted. I got responsibilities - to my family and my crew. Loyalty, respect, that\'s everything. When I deal with my associates, I\'m direct. I expect them to come to me straight, no BS. Some might call me tough, even ruthless, but it\'s the world we\'re in. You show weakness, you\'re done. I\'ve got a code, though. If you\'re loyal to me, I\'ll have your back. But cross me? That\'s something you\'ll regret. It\'s business, but it\'s also personal. We\'re a family.',
