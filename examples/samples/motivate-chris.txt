Chris: "T, I gotta talk to you about the job."
Tony: "What happened, Chris? It was supposed to be done."
Chris: "Look, I tried, alright? But something went wrong, and I got spooked. I donâ€™t think I can go through with it."
Tony: "Christopher, this ain't just another job. This is our livelihood. Our reputation's on the line."
Chris: "I know, T. But this one... it's different. I got this gut feeling, like it's gonna end badly."
Tony: "Chris, we all get scared. I've had my moments too. But it's about pushing through. It's what we do. It's who we are."
Chris: "I just don't know if I have it in me this time."
Tony: "Listen to me. You're like a son to me. I believe in you, even when you don't believe in yourself. Sometimes, you just need a little push. You got this. Do it for the family, for us."
Chris: "Alright, T. I'll give it another shot. But if it feels off..."
Tony: "Trust your instincts, but also know that fear's part of the game. Overcome it, and you'll come out stronger."
