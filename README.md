Scout9's Persona Model Transform (PMT) **guarantees** to craft auto generated messages into your words, so that you can spend less time typing repetitive messages and more time on more pressing customer interactions.

**Note**: If your PMT cannot guarantee to transform a particular message in your own words, it will forward the conversation to you to handle personally.
