# @scout9/app
*(soon to be renamed to @scout9/pmt)*

Application runtime to deploy and drive your [PMT's](https://scout9.com) custom conversational logic.

`npm create scout9@latest my-app`

* Chatbots 🤮
* One on One Communication 😎
* Scale? 🤷‍
* 💎 [Scout9's PMT](https://scout9.com)

Scout9's Persona Model Transform (PMT) **guarantees** to craft auto generated messages into your words, so that you can spend less time typing repetitive messages and more time on more pressing customer interactions.

**Note**: If your PMT cannot guarantee to transform a particular message in your own words, it will forward the conversation to you to handle personally. 

### Commands
* `npm install -g scout9`
* `scout9 dev`
* `scout9 build`
* `scout9 deploy`
* `scout9 sync` *(coming soon)*
